We're going to call Clearwater City Council meeting to order 7pm on October 10, 2022. Is there approval of the agenda? Is there a motion? Is there a second? I'm in the mayor. Does staff like to add some items to the agenda please? First one we'd like to add, we will number at resolution 22-67, is a donation from the Alliance Club, in the amount of $1,650. And that is money to be used towards adding gutters over at the wine's building. Do you want that in your business or concern? Under consent. Thank you. And then the second one under consent would be resolution 68. And that is approval to do for the fire department to make purchases that were budgeted in the amount of $16,000. $295.50 and we would like to authorize a purchase but then also authorize a budget amendment to transfer funds from the operating capital because this dollar makes a capital purchase. Can you say the dollar? $16,000. Sorry. $16,295.50. So those are both under the consent? Correct. And then under new business, the public works staff got a quote and wanted to know if the council would like to do fall street sweeping. And the quote was about $2,000. So we'll call that new business age. The other one's, I'm sorry, it just looks great. Any further discussion? All in favor? Opposed? Abstentions? Motion carries. Wright County Sheriff's report. I don't really have one. They told me to come just to attend one and if you have any questions for me Asking some questions and your name Taylor Marshall. The area started on my three or four months ago. Welcome. And the report may just for two. I have one question. Yes. Is there still an issue with dogs or any moves? I have not heard any of the reports in months now. I did cite the individual. Nailed it to him when I asked for the front door. So I nailed it to him and haven't heard anything since. I haven't had another call about it. Heard the guy that works when I'm off. I haven't mentioned it.
